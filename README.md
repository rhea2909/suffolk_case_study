# suffolk_case_study
Repository for hotel Cancellations project for Suffolk construction

Objective: This project aims to develop a predictive model to address the rising cancellation rates for a hotel chain. The model predicts the likelihood of a reservation being canceled using the "Hotel Booking Demand" dataset, which includes reservation details for City and Resort hotels. The model is trained on data from 2015-2016 and tested on 2017 data.
Scope: The analysis focuses on identifying key predictors of reservation cancellations and deploying the model in the hotel chain's booking system.
